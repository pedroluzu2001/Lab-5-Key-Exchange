# Lab 5 Key exchange
*Objective:* Key exchange allows us to pass a shared secret key between Bob and Alice. Themain methods for doing this are either encrypting with the public key, the Diffie Hellman
Method and the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) method. This lab investigates thesemethods.

## A  Diffie-Hellman

| A.1  | Bob and Alice have agreed on the values:<br> g=2879, N=9929<br>Bob selects x=6, Alice selects y=9         | Now calculate (using a calculator):<br>Bob's B value g<sup>x</sup> mod N:<br>4850<br>Alice's A value g<sup>y</sup>modN:<br>3614  |
| A.2  | Now they exchange the values. Next calculate the shared key:                                               | Bob's value A<sup>x</sup> mod N:<br>4868<>brAlice's value B<sup>y</sup> mod N:<br>4868<br>Do they match?<br> [Yes]               |
| A.3  | If you are in the lab, select someone to share a value with. Next, agree on two numbers (g and N).<br>You should generate a random number, and so should they. Do not tell them what your random number is<br>. Next, calculate your A value, and get them to do the same.<br>Next exchange values. | Numbers for g and N:<br>450, 184<br>Your x value: 2 <br>Your A value: 104<br>The B value you received: 100 <br>Shared key:<br>144<br>Do they match: [Yes]|

## C Discrete Logarithm

### C.1  ElGamal and Diffie Hellman use discrete logarithms. 
This involves a generator value (g) and a prime number. A basic operation is g <sup>x </sup>(mod p). If p=11, and g=2, determine the results (the first two have already been completed):
